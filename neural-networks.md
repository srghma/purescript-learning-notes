and
https://hackage.haskell.org/package/accelerate-1.2.0.1/docs/Data-Array-Accelerate.html#g:2

looks very good for manual/learning


granade is type-safe, but without gpu (using hmatrix internally)

hmatrix - accelerate too supports arrays with shapes https://hackage.haskell.org/package/accelerate-1.2.0.1/docs/Data-Array-Accelerate.html#t:Array

repa - is accelerate without gpu

---------

but anyway tensorflow is best, accelerate may not support gpu without tinkring

---------

also good http://hackage.haskell.org/package/ad
